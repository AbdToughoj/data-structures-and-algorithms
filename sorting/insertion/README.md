# Insertion Sort

## Step-by-Step Visualization

Let's now proceed with the step-by-step visualization of the Insertion Sort algorithm using the sample array [8, 4, 23, 42, 16, 15]. We will display the state of the sorted array after each iteration:

Initial State: sorted = []

Step 1

Iteration 1: Insert 8 into the sorted array.

After this step, sorted = [8]

Step 2

Iteration 2: Insert 4 into the sorted array.

After this step, sorted = [4, 8]

Step 3

Iteration 3: Insert 23 into the sorted array.

After this step, sorted = [4, 8, 23]

Step 4

Iteration 4: Insert 42 into the sorted array.

After this step, sorted = [4, 8, 23, 42]

Step 5

Iteration 5: Insert 16 into the sorted array.

After this step, sorted = [4, 8, 16, 23, 42]

Step 6

Iteration 6: Insert 15 into the sorted array.

After this step, sorted = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
